# WiredCats-10022-SkyStone-2019
The code for our FTC team, 10022, in the 2019 Skystone Challenge.

TeleOp:
DPAD: controls the linear slides.
  left and right extend the horizontal slides backward and forward, respectively.
  up and down control the vertical slides up and down.
    as of when I am writing this, these are controlled manually,
    but the goal is for the driver to just click up or down and the
    slides will automatically go to the next level (up or down, as requested.)
    as of now, our robot can place stones up to 4-high on the platform.
    this includes the capstone.
Joysticks: control the drivetrain
  left joystick: forward & backwards -- fieldcentric! we also have robotcentric drive.
    the A button allows the driver to switch between the two.
  right joystick: left & right: turning
A Button: allows the drivers to switch between fieldcentric and robotcentric drive
X Button: 
Y Button: 
B Button: 

all buttons listed have functions. however, I am now taking a break to implement the fieldcentric code into the teleop program,
as well as implement the function of the A button
